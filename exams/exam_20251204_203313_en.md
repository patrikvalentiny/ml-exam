## Answer Key

**1.** C. Late 19th century and early 20th century

**2.** Mentioning any two of the following features (or other relevant ones) is considered a correct answer:
* Departure from traditional forms and realism
* Search for new means of expression and forms
* Subjectivity, individualism
* Fragmentation, non-linear narrative
* Interest in the psychology of characters/human mind
* Critique of society and its values
* Often pessimism, anxiety about the new world

**3.** C. Cubism

**4.** The answer should fundamentally capture that experimentation was crucial for modernism in the effort to break free from traditional rules and find new forms of expression in response to a changing world.
Experimentation played a key and fundamental role in the modernist period. It was the driving force for:
* Breaking conventions and traditional rules.
* Searching for entirely new forms, structures, and means of expression in literature, visual arts, music, and architecture.
* Expanding the boundaries of art and exploring its possibilities.
* Reacting to a rapidly changing world and attempting to grasp it artistically in non-traditional ways.

**5.** For example:
* James Joyce (Ulysses)
* Marcel Proust (In Search of Lost Time)
* Franz Kafka (The Trial / The Metamorphosis)
* T.S. Eliot (The Waste Land)
* Virginia Woolf (Mrs. Dalloway)
